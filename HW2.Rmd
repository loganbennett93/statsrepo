## 2-3

False. As the sample size increases, the sampling distribution approaches a normal shape, regardless of the population distribution due to the the Central Limit Theorem. However, this does not mean that the histogram of the sample is necessarily normal.

## 2-6

Y-bar is the sample statistic that will be used to approximate the value of mu, which is the parameter that we are trying to estimate. A hypothesis must be about the unknown parameter.

## 2-7

The hypothesis that the mean difference is zero the null hypothesis. We can say with 95% confidence that the difference in head circumference is between 0.61 and 1.19 cm. Since 0 cm is not within that 95% confidence interval, we have reason to believe that the null hypothesis is not true. We can say that the p-value is below 0.05, which refers to the 5% chance that the statistic we got was strictly due to chance.

## 2-13

``` {r 2-13, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
#install.packages("ANOVAreplication")
library("ANOVAreplication")
data13 <- (ex0112)
fishoil <- filter(data13, Diet == "FishOil")
regularoil <- filter(data13, Diet == "RegularOil")
meanfishoil <- mean(fishoil[1:7, 1:1])
meanregularoil <- mean(regularoil[1:7, 1:1])
sdfishoil <- sd(fishoil$BP)
sdregularoil <- sd(regularoil$BP)

pooledsd <- pooled.sd(data13)

standardE <- pooledsd*sqrt((1/7)+(1/7))

t95 <- 2.179
halfwidth <- t95 * standardE
lowerlimit <- (meanfishoil - meanregularoil) - halfwidth
upperlimit <- (meanfishoil - meanregularoil) + halfwidth

tstat <- ((meanfishoil - meanregularoil) - 0) / standardE

#t.test(fishoil$BP,regularoil$BP, var.equal = T)

```
a.
The average of the fish oil group is __`r meanfishoil`__.  
The average of the regular oil group is __`r meanregularoil`__.  
The sample standard deviation of the fish oil group is __`r sdfishoil`__.  
The sample standard deviation of the regular oil group is __`r sdregularoil`__.

b.
The pooled estimate of the standard deviation is __`r pooledsd`__.

c.
The standard error is __`r standardE`__.

d.
The degrees of freedom associated with the pooled estimate of the standard deviation is equal to $$n_2+n_1-2$$, which in this case is equal to $$7+7-2=12$$. The 97.5th percentile of the t-distribution with 12 degrees of freedom is __2.179__.

e.
A 95% confidence interval for the difference in population means has a lower limit of __`r lowerlimit`__ and an upper limit of __`r upperlimit`__.

f.
The *t*-statistic for testing equality is __`r tstat`__.

e.
Based off of the Student's T-Table and a *t*-statistic of `r tstat`, the one-sided *p*-value is __0.005__.

These results are confirmed by a t-test, which gives a two-sided p-value:

``` {r ttest, echo = FALSE}
t.test(fishoil$BP,regularoil$BP, var.equal = T)
```


## 2-18


a. 
```{r 2-18a, echo = FALSE}
data18 <- (ex0218)
data1976 <- filter(data18, Year == "1976")
data1978 <- filter(data18, Year == "1978")
boxplot(data1976$Depth, data1978$Depth,
        main = "Beak Depths by Year",
        xlab = "1976                                                        1978",
        ylab = "Beak Depth (mm)")
```
b.
```{r 2-18b, echo = FALSE}
#Do a t-test with a one-sided p-value (omit alternative = "greater" for two-sided)
#do the 1978 data first because we use mu2 - mu1
t.test(data1978$Depth, data1976$Depth, var.equal = T, alternative = "greater")
```
As provided in the above t-test, the one-sided *p*-value is __1.617e-06__.

c.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
